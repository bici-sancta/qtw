Assignment: Use Multiple Imputation  
Click here to download and analyze the data set using multiple imputation.  
Use PROC MI to discover the missing values patterns and to decide what MI options to use. (Assume no need for transformations.)  
Use PROC MI to create multiple imputed data sets.  
Use PROC REG to analyze the multiple data sets while outputting information to be used in MIANALYZE.  
Use PROC MIANALYZE to summarize the imputed analyses.  
Compare these results to the listwise deletion results.  


Formatting  
Case study write-ups are to be “technical report ready,” which basically means that the write-up is suitable for public viewing.
  
Your name must be at the top of the first page and on each successive page.  
Submit case studies as a formal written paper. The case study should have an abstract, an introduction, a literature review, a methods section, a results section, and a future work/discussion/conclusion section. Code should be included in an appendix to the document. Spelling and grammar count!  
Use an easy-to-read variable-width font (I like Ariel, Helvetica, and Geneva fonts—this document is in Helvetica 11 point) with a minimum of 11 point font.  
Relevant code and output must be included in-line at the appropriate point using Courier New (or other fixed-width) font, in 10-point size. Inclusion of irrelevant code or output, even in an appendix, will be penalized. All software output must be given in the text or as a table created in Word (or the software you are using).  
Any graphics must be electronically cut and pasted in-line at the appropriate point of the write-up. You can use Word to resize the graphics appropriately. Screen shots from SAS, R, or Python tabular output are not allowed in the document text or in the appendix. All tables and figures should have descriptive titles and captions. In short, the reader should be able to understand the content of the figure or table without reading the associated text.  
Any mathematical notation must be provided with appropriate use of subscripts, superscripts, and symbols. Use MS Equation or another equation editor if you submit your work in Word.
